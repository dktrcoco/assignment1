First homework assignment

I altered the div's to be more specific (ie - nav, section, aside, etc)
I changed the .css file so classes were not needd in the .html file in several places.
I structured the html elements in a logical fashion that is consistent with common practice.
I added alt text for the images in the .html file.
I added a descriptive title to the title element.
